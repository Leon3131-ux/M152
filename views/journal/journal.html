                                I've already had a lot of experience when it comes to programming websites so I didn't learn a whole lot of new things in that departement.
                                It was hoverver nice to have so reassurance in my skills and abilities to do so since I haven't programmed a website in quite some time.

                                I did however learn a whole lot of new things about all the things surrounding copyright and how that is handled.
                                I've also never really learned alot about the different file formats that exist for videos and such so it was nice to get to read into that too.
                                The last thing I want to mention that was new to me was everything regarding animations.

                                What I did<br>
                                Let’s do this short and fast, since there isn’t much to write about. I mostly did the writing and the research for the different topics; I was the docs guys. I also did some programming.<br>
                                What I learned<br>
                                Since I don’t program frontend that much, I’ve learned a couple of new tricks and extended my knowledge. I also learned many things about copyright and all the different file formats.<br>
